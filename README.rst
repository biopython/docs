Automatically generated Biopython documentation
===============================================

This is new as of Biopython 1.74, released 16 July 2019.

The idea is that code changes on https://github.com/biopython/biopython
already undergo continuous integration testing, and one of those jobs will
render the latest documentation, and for the master branch, push it to this
separate https://github.com/biopython/docs/ repository on the ``gh-pages``
branch, from where it can be automatically published using GitHub pages.

The intention is to use https://biopython.org/docs/dev/api/ for the API
documentation for latest master branch, with ``/dev/`` replaced with the
version for releases, e.g. https://biopython.org/docs/1.74/api/ and a
symlink such that https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/ points at the
latest release (which will need updating with each release).

We would not expect or intend to edit the documentation directly in this
repository.

If you find a mistake in the documentation, please check the dev version,
and if it is still broken, please file an issue on the main repository:
https://github.com/biopython/biopython/issues
